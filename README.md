## Topic: Implementation of decission tree using below heuristic
- Information Gain
- Varince Impurity

### To run this program please provide the input  paramters in the below format

  ### Please provide the argument in the format as stated below:-
  ```Syntax
      python decissionTree.py <L> <K> <training-dataSet-path> <validation-dataSet-path> <test-dataSet-path> <to-print>
       L: integer (used in the post-pruning algorithm)
       K: integer (used in the post-pruning algorithm)
       to-print:{yes,no}
  ```

### Final Output report will be generated in the output.txt which you can find at root location 

- [x] Note: In Data 0 index to Decission tree means Information gain and 1 means variance impurity heuristic
